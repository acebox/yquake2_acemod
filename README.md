Description             : This mod started as a successor to my old Doom/Skulltag project,
						basically a randomizer that "blends" in anything the game has to offer.
						Also are some assorted tweaks to gameplay, engine, etc..  The custom 
						engine that I played around with is similar to Vanilla/Yamagi Q2 - just
						added Psychospaz/KMQ2 particle effects and other small changes.  This is
						basically an upload of the code needed to run this mod, extract the needed
						models, sounds, etc.. from the mission packs into the acemod folder (rogue
						monster models for last, as they have extra animation frames).

Additional Credits to   : Psychospaz/KMQuake2 for the particle system I used as a base,	
						Quakesrc.org and other "lost" dll tutorials, and a throwback nod to this
						readme template.  Xatrix/Rogue/Zaero for the mission pack code (modded to
						fit).

This is just a random experiment I've been playing with recently, Quake II 
is one of my favorite games.  You may use this to learn and play with, the
game is old and I just wanted to see what I could cook up with the source 
code nowadays.  I'm not responsible if your microwave starts going rick
rolled after flipping pancakes.  Have a nice day.
